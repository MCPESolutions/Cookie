# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive packet hooking system for intercepting and managing all network packets in the EUTOPIA Minecraft client. The system should be stable, efficient, and provide a unified interface for packet interception without causing crashes or performance issues.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to intercept all incoming and outgoing network packets, so that I can implement features that depend on network traffic analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the packet hook system is initialized THEN it SHALL hook all available packet types automatically
2. WHEN a packet is received or sent THEN the system SHALL trigger appropriate event handlers
3. WHEN packet interception fails for a specific packet type THEN the system SHALL log the failure and continue operating
4. WHEN the system encounters an unknown packet type THEN it SHALL handle it gracefully without crashing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to cancel or modify packets before they are processed, so that I can implement features like packet filtering or modification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a packet event is triggered THEN event handlers SHALL be able to cancel the packet
2. WHEN a packet is cancelled THEN the system SHALL replace it with a safe dummy packet to prevent crashes
3. WHEN a packet is modified THEN the modified version SHALL be processed instead of the original
4. WHEN packet cancellation occurs THEN the original packet flow SHALL not be disrupted

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the packet hook system to integrate with the existing hook manager, so that it follows the established patterns and is maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the packet hook is created THEN it SHALL use the existing Detour class from HookManager
2. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL register with the existing hook management system
3. WHEN cleanup is needed THEN the system SHALL properly unhook all detours
4. WHEN the system is disabled THEN all packet hooks SHALL be safely removed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging and error handling, so that I can debug issues and ensure system stability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN packet hooking begins THEN the system SHALL log the number of packets being hooked
2. WHEN a packet hook fails THEN the system SHALL log the specific packet ID and error details
3. WHEN hooking completes THEN the system SHALL report success statistics and timing
4. WHEN runtime errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged without crashing the application

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the packet hook system to be performant, so that it doesn't impact game performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN packets are processed THEN the overhead SHALL be minimal
2. WHEN multiple packets arrive simultaneously THEN they SHALL be processed efficiently
3. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL complete within a reasonable time frame
4. WHEN packet events are triggered THEN they SHALL not block the main game thread
